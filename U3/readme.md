<div align= "justify">

    This work made me understand 2 things
>1.- It was hard for me to be able to understand things that are still hard for me today

>2.- programming is something that is practiced every day, I liked programming in this project even though I needed a little help but thanks to this now I will practice more daily so as not to forget things
