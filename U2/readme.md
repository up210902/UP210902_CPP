## What is the purpose of this program? well, the program was made with a simple instruction

## This instruction is:
    In a certain company, its employees are evaluated at the end of each year.
    The points that can be obtained in the evaluation start at 0.0 and can go up, translating into better benefits. 
    The points you can get employees can be 0.0, 0.4, 0.6 or more, but not intermediate values between the figures mentioned. Below is a table with thelevels corresponding to each score. The amount of money earned
    on each level is $2,400 multiplied by the level score.

    Level Score
    Unacceptable 0.0
    Acceptable 0.4
    Merit 0.6 or more

    Write a program that reads the user's score and indicates their level of performance,
